                    Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to
                    the user experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used
                    to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for
                    mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.
                    <br><br>
                    A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website.
                    Appearance, for instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how
                    information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing,
                    and suits the user group and brand of the website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on
                    simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users
                    appears. As the keystone of a web designers output is a site that wins and fosters the trust of the
                    target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical
                    consideration. <br><br>

                    Within this course, we have compiled and consolidated some of the best resources currently available
                    on the subject of Gestalt psychology and visual perception. To help you appreciate how you can apply
                    Gestalt psychology to web design, we have provided many different examples from existing designs.
                    These draw attention to the exact qualities, quirks, and features of visual perception. Moreover,
                    they discuss how these have been accommodated and, on a number of occasions, exploited so as to
                    support either the user's intentions or those of the designer or client.
                    <br>
                    Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are
                    responsive and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen
                    size; in adaptive design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen
                    sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to
                    maintaining user trust and engagement. As responsive design can present difficulties in this regard,
                    designers must be careful in relinquishing control of how their work will appear. If they are
                    responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy
                    having the advantage of full control of the finished product.
